# Introduction

`project-scaffold-gen-i` was built to show how Bash scripting can solve real-world problems in a simple and neat way. The script provides an interactive, logic-based method to create new projects, labs, or general folder structures without depending on frameworks, templates, or outside tools.

## Why I Built This

In the early stages of nearly every technical project, there is a need to establish structure. Whether it's a proof of concept, a write-up, a tool, or a red team lab, I repeatedly created the same folders and placeholder files by hand. Instead of continuing that cycle, I decided to automate the process, with a focus on transparency, clarity, and user choice.

This script isn’t designed to be flashy or excessive. Its purpose is to complete the task, demonstrate the flexibility of the shell, and provide a solid, minimal starting point for nearly any project.This script isn’t meant to be flashy or bloated. It’s meant to get the job done, show off the flexibility of the shell, and serve as a solid, minimal starting point for almost any kind of project.

## What It Shows

This project demonstrates:

- Interactive CLI design using Bash alone
- Clean user input handling with conditionals and loops
- Scoped filesystem creation logic
- The value of clear, modular script structure
- How to keep tools usable without being over-engineered

## Philosophy

No dependency chains. No abstraction for its own sake. Just a clean CLI workflow that does one job well. It reflects how real professionals work from the command line.

This tool is part of a larger effort to create useful command-line tools that reflect clear thinking and practical engineering.
